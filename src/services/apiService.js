Thank you for your feature suggestion! We really appreciate customers like you who take the time to help us improve our product.

I'm happy to inform you that a dark mode feature is actually on our development roadmap. Many users have requested this feature, and we understand its importance for reducing eye strain during extended use.

Here's what I can share:
- Our development team is actively working on implementing dark mode
- Expected release: Q2 2024
- It will include automatic switching based on system preferences and manual toggle options

In the meantime, here are some tips that might help:
- Try using your browser's dark mode or reader mode
- Adjust your screen brightness and use blue light filters
- Consider browser extensions that can apply dark themes to websites

I've added your request to our feature request tracker, which helps our team prioritize development based on user demand. You'll receive an email notification once this feature is released.

Thank you again for your valuable feedback!

Best regards,
Customer Support Team`
